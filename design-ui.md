## 2. Visual Style & Aesthetics
**Minimalist and Trustworthy Feel**
- Clean and Spacious:
  - Use a grid-based layout with ample white (or light neutral) space to avoid clutter and enhance readability.
  - A minimalist design that emphasizes key actions and information without unnecessary embellishments.
- Modern Components:
  - Rounded corners on cards, buttons, and input fields to create a soft, approachable interface.
  - Use subtle drop shadows and depth effects to signify active elements and cards, giving a sense of hierarchy.
  - **NEW:** Consistent visual language for transaction statuses (pending, in escrow, released, disputed) with intuitive color coding.
- Imagery & Icons:
  - Custom icons that represent actions (e.g., a shield for security, handshake for agreements).
  - Use vector illustrations sparingly, such as in onboarding screens, to explain the escrow process.
  - **NEW:** Animated security elements that provide subtle visual feedback during sensitive operations.

## 3. Color Palette
**Primary Colors for Trust & Simplicity**
- Primary Color:
  - Deep Blue or Navy: Conveys reliability and security. Use this for headers, call-to-action buttons, and key icons.
- Secondary Color:
  - Soft Teal or Accent Cyan: Adds a modern touch that pairs well with blue, used for progress indicators, secondary buttons, or highlights.
- Neutral Colors:
  - Light Gray or Off-White: Background color to create an airy and clean look.
  - Dark Gray: For text elements to ensure high contrast and readability.
- Alert Colors:
  - Use a muted Red or Orange for warning or error notifications.
  - Use a soft Green for successful transactions or confirmations.
- **NEW:** Alternate Palettes:
  - Customizable light/dark mode toggle with appropriate color adjustments.
  - Regional color themes that align with cultural preferences for international markets.

## 4. Typography
**Readable and Modern Fonts**
- Primary Typeface:
  - Sans-serif fonts such as Helvetica, Open Sans, or Roboto for clarity and modernity.
- Hierarchy:
  - Headlines & Titles: Bold, larger size (e.g., 24-30px) for clear emphasis.
  - Subheadings: Semi-bold, medium size (e.g., 18-20px).
  - Body Text: Regular weight, comfortable size (e.g., 14-16px) with proper line spacing.
- Consistency:
  - Uniform use of font weights and sizes throughout the app to promote ease of scanning and maintain design integrity.
- **NEW:** Dynamic Text Sizing:
  - Responsive typography that adjusts based on device and user preferences.
  - Accessibility options for increased text size without breaking layouts.

## 5. Interaction Design & Animations
**Smooth, Intuitive Interactions**
- Button & Link States:
  - Use subtle color changes or shadows on hover and active states to indicate interactiveness.
- Page Transitions:
  - Smooth animations when navigating between pages or during form transitions. For example, a simple slide or fade can reinforce progress without distraction.
- Microinteractions:
  - Provide visual feedback on user actions (e.g., checkmark animation upon completing a step in the transaction process).
  - Employ loader animations for background processing (e.g., while fetching transaction details) that align with the overall color scheme.
- Error Handling & Feedback:
  - Clear inline form validations with gentle animations to direct user attention.
  - Use modal dialogs or toast notifications for system messages that do not interrupt the user workflow abruptly.
- **NEW:** Mobile Gesture Support:
  - Implement swipe gestures for common actions (approve, reject, scroll through transactions).
  - Add pull-to-refresh for transaction updates and haptic feedback for confirmation actions.
- **NEW:** Quick Actions:
  - Floating action button that presents contextual options based on transaction state.
  - Smart command bar for power users with keyboard shortcuts on desktop.

## 6. Accessibility & Responsiveness
**Design for All Users & Devices**

  - High-contrast color combinations and adjustable text sizes to assist users with visual impairments.
